## Claim Analysis 
### Article Reference
 The Role of ENSO in Global Ocean Temperature Changes during 1955-2011 Simulated with a 1D Climate Model (Spencer and Braswell, 2014).

### Article Summary
This paper explores a simplistic model which treats the ocean as a uniform water body with no horizontal energy flow. Using this model, it seeks to elucidate the sensitivity of the earth’s climate to greenhouse gasses. To do this, it included 3 scenarios. Scenario 1, only human and volcanic impacts are included. Scenario 2 combined natural variability associated with ocean mixing into the first model.  Finally, scenario 3 combined the change of energy inputs from cloud formations into scenario 2. These models are compared to the recorded temperature of ocean depths found in Levitus which are recordings of the natural temperature variations which occurred during El Nino and La Nina known collectively as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Spencer uses the relatively small differences of ocean warming on the models to suggest that the levels of ocean warming observed are weak evidence of anthropogenic climate change. 

### Article Evaluation
 The two main authors of this paper are Roy W. Spencer and William D. Braswell. The two of them are consistent climate skeptics collaborating as far back as 2007 (ResearchGate, 2021). The more prominent of these scientists is Roy Spencer, a figure in climate change skepticism since it was first being theorized. Spencer has legitimate academic credentials having a Ph.D in meteorology (Roy Spencer (scientist), 2021). However there has been evidence of institutional investors funding his work. Firstly, Roy Spencer was a principal scientist of the George C. Marshall institute, which received substantial donations from the fossil fuel industry (Powell, 2011; Marshall Institute, 2012). He has also been published by the Texas Public Policy Foundation which has received substantial investments from climate change skeptic interest groups (Grandia, 2021). While his funding doesn’t invalidate the arguments of the paper, when combined with statements questioning evolution and books with clear political goals, it makes the possibility of a conflict of interest quite plausible (TCS Daily, 2009; Spencer, 2012). These factors combined with his focus on challenging consensus climate science over the years suggest the purpose of this paper may be to use this model to advocate for anthropogenic climate change skepticism by creating some amount of perceived doubt within the scientific community. 

Next it is important to note that even if the model were accurate, that this paper exists within a wide ecosystem of models and data analysis on the climate crisis. Taking one model analysis of one geographically limited region as a complete rebuttal of swathes of papers which have different explanations for El Nino and papers which describe different geographic regions is inherently flawed (Hall et al., 2015). As always changes in scientific consensus should be considered as an incremental process, and one outlier result should be viewed with skepticism in its veracity in overturning a whole field until proven otherwise. 

In addition, this paper’s conclusions rest upon the model of the climate which it uses. Other papers by educated experts in the field have challenged the validity of the model on the following grounds shown in the figure below (Abraham et al., 2014).

Figure 1: The list of flaws with the 1 dimensional model in the paper (Abraham et al., 2014)

Correcting these mistakes in the model reveals that the 1-dimensional model used is a poor model for energy transfer, with the figure below showing how correcting these mistakes reveals the discrepancy between the model and data.

Figure 2: The rate of temperature increase in the upper 100 metres compared to the 1D simple model of the original paper and the corrected model of the new paper (Abraham et al., 2014).

Given the limited applicability of the data to conclusions about the globe, the flaws of the model used and the possible conflicts of interest of the author the final conclusion is that the results of this paper are flawed and do not present a reasonable counter argument to anthropogenic climate change.
